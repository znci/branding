# branding

Purely for the reason our websites always looking fresh and the same!

## Usage

### CSS Usage

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://branding.znci.dev/css/index.css" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

### JS Usage

```html
<script src="https://branding.znci.dev/js/index.js" crossorigin="anonymous" defer></script>
```

`defer` is used for when someone puts the javascript tag at the top of the file, it will load after everything else.

### Fonts

Some of the fonts might not work, so a sans-serif fallback is added.
If the fonts don't work, just enable them locally.
